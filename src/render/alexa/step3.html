	<h1>Skill Configuration</h1>

	<p>Once you've clicked into the <b>Configuration</b> tab, we'll need to configure the endpoints. This means we have to build our ARN, or Amazon Resource Name. We'll have to use AWS for this.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Navigate to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">aws.amazon.com</a>.</li>
		<li>Change your location at the top right to <b>N.Virginia</b>. This is the only physical servers that supports Alexa Skills thus far.</li>
		<li>Make sure you've verified your email with your AWS account. If you haven't, there may be errors that show up that don't seem to make sense.</li>
		<li>Navigate to <b>Lambda</b>.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Build your Lambda Function</h2>

	<p>Lambda is a really useful tool that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has built to allow you to run a service without provisioning your own servers. Here, we'll be using Lambda to store and run our Skills code.</p>

	<p>We'll be creating a Lambda function using <b>Python 3.6</b>. There may be some blueprint, or template, for an Alexa skill for other languages, and you can explore these if you'd like. However, we'll be starting with a blank one, since Python 3.6 doesn't have an Alexa blueprint.</p>

	<p>Now, we have a trigger, which is the event that launches the Lambda function. In our case, we'll select the <b>Alexa Skills Kit</b>. Click continue, and we'll have some Lambda information we'll have to configure:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Name</span> is the lambda function name. You can name this whatever you like.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Description</span> can be whatever you want as well.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Runtime</span>. We'll be using Python 3.6.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Code Your Skill</h2>

	<p>Now, we'll build the actual logic behind the skill. We've made a skeleton for your convenience. You can visit <a href="/alexa/code.html">this page</a> to copy the code into a text editor of your choice.</p>

	<p>Now, we'll walk through your code.</p>
