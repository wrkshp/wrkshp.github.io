		<h2>Launching</h2>

		<p>The final step of your skill would be to publish your skill into the Alexa Skills Store. In any other skill, you will move onto the <b>Launch</b> tab at the top of the page and complete the fields as it asks. These are fairly self explanatory, and you should be able to figure them out yourselves. <span class="emphasis">Unfortunately, you will not be able to publish this particular Pokemon skill, as Pokemon is copyrighted by Nintendo.</span></p>

		<p>If it's any incentive, Amazon offers <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion">a free shirt</a> each month to developers who successfully publish a skill. Make sure to follow all the terms and conditions in order to get the shirt. And, if your skill becomes one of the top engaging skills, Amazon will <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/rewards">give you money</a>.</p>
