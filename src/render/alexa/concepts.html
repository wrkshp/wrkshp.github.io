			<li><span class="emphasis">Utterances</span> are how the user would speak to Alexa. It's a list of things that the developer would define that would encompass all the phrases that someone can use to trigger your app.</li>
			<li><span class="emphasis">Intents</span> are how Alexa handles the requests that the user makes to Alexa. There are 3 required intents that Alexa forces you to have: AMAZON.StopIntent, AMAZON.HelpIntent, and AMAZON.CancelIntent. These are fairly self explanatory.</li>
			<li><span class="emphasis">Slots</span> are basically the variables that you'd want your user to fill in when making an utterance.</li>

		<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"><h2>AWS Lambda</h2></a>
		<p>Lambda is a really useful tool that Amazon Web Services has built to allow you to run a service without provisioning your own servers. In an Alexa Skills context, it's what the Alexa service calls when a user calls your skill. This is where the code for your skill lives.</p>
