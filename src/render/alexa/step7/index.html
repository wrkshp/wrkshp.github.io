	<h1>Finalizing Lambda</h1>

	<h2>Upload Your Code</h2>

	<p>Now, we'll navigate to Lambda in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS console</a> again and navigate to the function we created earlier.</p>

	<p>Under the <b>Function code</b> section, paste the code into the editor here.</p>

	<p>Click save. You've successfully created your Lambda function!</p>

	<h2>ARN</h2>

	<p>Now remember the reason we came here was because we were looking for an ARN, or Amazon Resource Number. This should be at the top right corner of your page. A couple things to make sure of: your location is in <b>N.Virginia</b>, and your ARN includes <b>us-east-1</b> in it. Remember, this is the only physical location in AWS for Alexa Skills so far. Your skill won't work without this configured properly.</p>

	<p>Navigate back to your <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/">developer.amazon.com</a> tab, and in the <b>Default Region</b> box, paste in the ARN. We don't have to worry about the rest of this page. Click <b>Save Endpoints</b> at the top of the page.</p>
