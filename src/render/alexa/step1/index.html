		<h2>Setup</h2>
		<p>Make sure you've made all the accounts necessary. If you haven't, <a href="https://wrkshp.github.io/alexa/#setup">go back to the Setup section</a> and follow all of the steps.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Adding a New Skill</h2>

	<p>Navigate to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/">developer.amazon.com</a>. Click the <b>Alexa</b> tab, scroll to the bottom, and select the <b>Alexa Skills Kit</b>. Click <b>Start a Skill</b> in the top right corner. Sign into your Amazon account. If you haven't created a developer account yet, you'll be prompted to do so now.</p>

	<p>Once you've reached the developer home page, select <b>Alexa Skills Kit</b> and hit <b>Create Skill</b>.</p>

	<p>Now we need to fill in a few fields to identify our skill.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Skill Name</span> is the name shown in the skills store. It can be anything you want.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Skill Type</span> is our custom interaction model, which includes our intents and slots. It's our custom way of talking to Alexa. <b>Select</b> this type and hit <b>Create Skill</b> at the top to continue.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You'll be taken to the Skills Developer landing page for your skill. We'll go through the Skill Builder Checklist now. You can also see this checklist in the left menu.</p>

	<p>We'll do the easiest step first: the <b>Invocation Name</b>. This is what name we use when we talk to Alexa. For example, if our invocation name is "echomon", we would say, "Ask echomon to ____".</p>

	<p>Hit <b>Save Model</b> at the top, then select <b>Intents</b> in the left menu. Or, from the Skills Builder Checklist on the Landing Page, click on the <b>Intents, Samples, and Slots</b> item in the checklist to take you straight to the intent creation page.</p>
