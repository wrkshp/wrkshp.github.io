	<h1>A New Skill</h1>

	<div class="floating-container">
		<h2>Setup</h2>
		<p>Make sure you've made all the accounts necessary. If you haven't, <a href="https://wrkshp.github.io/alexa/#setup">go back to the Setup section</a> and follow all of the steps.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Adding a New Skill</h2>

	<p>Navigate to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/">developer.amazon.com</a> and sign into your account. Hover over the <b>Alexa</b> tab and select the <b>Alexa Skills Kit</b>. Click <b>Create Skill</b> on the right.</p>

	<p>Now we need to fill in a few fields to identify our skill.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Skill Name</span> is the name shown in the skills store. It can be anything you want.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Skill Model</span> is the basic model that contains intents and utterances that you use in your skill. There's a few predefined ones, but we will choose <b>Custom</b>, which allows us to define our own model. Hit <b>Create Skill</b> at the top to continue.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Backend Resource</span> is how you'll be providing the backend for your skill. We'll be <b>Provisioning our own</b> backend resources.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Template</span> are types of custom skills that you can choose from. While these look fun, we'll just be using the <b>Start from Scratch</b> template. Click <b>Choose</b> at the top right to continue.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You'll be taken to the Skills Developer landing page for your skill. We'll go through the Skill Builder Checklist now. You can also see this checklist in the left menu.</p>

	<p>We'll do the easiest step first: the <b>Invocation Name</b>. This is what name we use when we talk to Alexa. For example, if our invocation name is "echomon", we would say, "Ask echomon to ____". It automatically fills this item in using your Skill Name, but you can choose whatever you like.</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
		Some requirements on the Invocation Name: it can only contain lower case letters, spaces, apostrophes, and periods.
	</div>
	
	<p>Hit <b>Save Model</b> at the top, then select <b>Intents</b> in the left menu. Or, from the Skills Builder Checklist on the Landing Page, click on the <b>Intents, Samples, and Slots</b> item in the checklist to take you straight to the intent creation page.</p>
