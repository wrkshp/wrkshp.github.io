	<h1>Interaction Model</h1>

	<h2>Intents</h2>

	<p>If you entered from the left menu, you'll see a list of all of our intents. An <span class="emphasis">intent</span> is how Alexa handles the request that the use makes to Alexa.</p>

	<p>So far, we have 4 built in intents. AMAZON.StopIntent, AMAZON.HelpIntent, and AMAZON.CancelIntent are required and fairly self explanatory.</p>

	<p>Click <b>Add Intent</b> to create the custom intent.</p>

	<h2>Creating an Intent</h2>

	<p>We'll create a custom intent called <b>GetPokemonIntent</b>. Click <b>Create Custom Intent</b>.</p>

	<p>Now we can customize the intent's utterances and slots. <span class="emphasis">Utterances</span> are how the user would speak to Alexa, and <span class="emphasis">slots</span> are the variables that you'd want your user to fill in when making an utterance.</p>

	<h2>Intent Slots</h2>

	<p>At the bottom half of the window, we'll add some custom slots first. We'll add one called <b>PokedexNumber</b>, which we're going to use to ask Alexa for a specific Pokemon. We'll choose a slot type of <b>AMAZON.NUMBER</b>, which is one of the prebuilt types.</p>

	<p>This also automatically adds a new <span class="emphasis">Slot Type</span> in the left menu. You should see AMAZON.NUMBER appear there now.</p>

	<h2>Adding Some Utterances</h2>

	<p>Now, we'll define some sample utterances. The utterance is what we're going to ask Alexa to invoke the GetPokemonIntent, and we'll be using the slot that we just defined. For example:</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
		<p>"What is the name of pokemon {PokedexNumber}"</p>
	</div>

	<p>You can go ahead and add as many of these as you want. Let's make a simpler one.</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
		<p>"Who is {PokedexNumber}"</p>
	</div>

	<p>Generally a production skill will have over 100 of these to cover all the phrasings that a user might use. The more you add, the better it is for your customers to use it.</p>

	<p>Hit <b>Save Model</b> at the top, then click <b>Build Model</b>. This may take a few seconds, but they will notify you when it's finished.</p>

	<p>Now we'll configure our skill.</p>
