	<h1>Interaction Model</h1>

	<p>Click into the <b>Interaction Model</b> and launch the <b>Skill Builder</b>.</p>

	<h2>Creating an Intent</h2>

	<p>We'll create a custom intent called <b>GetPokemonIntent</b>. For this intent, we're going to add custom slots on the right hand side. We'll add one called <b>PokedexNumber</b>, which we're going to use to ask Alexa for a specific Pokemon. We'll choose a slot type of <b>AMAZON.NUMBER</b>, which is one of Amazon's few prebuilt types.</p>

	<h2>Adding Some Utterances</h2>

	<p>Now, we'll define some sample utterances. This is what we're going to ask Alexa to invoke the GetPokemonIntent. For example:</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
		<p>"What is the name of pokemon {PokedexNumber}"</p>
	</div>

	<p>You can go ahead and add as many of these as you want. Let's make a simpler one.</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
		<p>"Who is {PokedexNumber}"</p>
	</div>

	<p>Generally a production skill will have over 100 of these to cover all the phrasings that a user might use. The more you add, the better it is for your customers to use it.</p>

	<div class="floating-container">
		<h2>Save Your Skill</h2>

		<p>To save and submit your skill, <span class="emphasis">MAKE SURE YOU CLICK <b>SAVE MODEL</b> FIRST</span>. If you don't, you may lose all your work!</p>

		<p>After you save your model, click <b>Build Model</b>. This may take a few seconds.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Now we'll configure our skill.</p>
