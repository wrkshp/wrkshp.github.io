	<h1>Configuring Lambda</h1>

	<h2>Upload Your Code</h2>

	<p>Now, we'll navigate to Lambda in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS console</a> again.</p>

	<p>Under the <b>Code</b> tab, we'll paste the code that we have now. You can ignore the Environment Variables for now.</p>

	<h2>Configure your Lambda</h2>

	<p>Click the <b>Configuration</b> tab. Here we'll fill out a few things.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Runtime</span> must be whatever language your code is written in. In our case, it's <b>Python 3.6</b>.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Handler</span> is the entry point, or the <span class="code">main</span> function that we have to call. In our case, we'll fill this out with <span class="code">lambda_function.lambda_handler</span>, which is made up of two things:
		<ul>
			<li><span class="code emphasis">lambda_function</span> refers to the fact that we used the "inline" option to submit our code, and thus only have one file. If you build a more complicated skill, you'll have more files to choose from, so in that case, you would replace this with the filename.</li>
			<li><span class="code emphasis">lambda_handler</span> refers to the function name in the <span class="code">lambda_function</span> that we specified. In our case, we've called our function <span class="code">lambda_handler</span>, which is by default.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Role</span> is used to specify the permissions function. While we won't be diving into what this is exactly, you can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role">learn more here</a>. For our purposes, we'll be creating a new role from a template.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Role Name</span> is the name of the roll. You can name this whatever you want, but we'll be calling ours <b>AlexaSkill</b>.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Policy Template</span> is simply a template for our permissions that we have to define. We won't be diving into this, but you can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/policy-templates.html">learn more here</a>. We only need <b>Simple Microservice permissions</b>, so select that.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Description</span> describes your skill. Use whatever you want.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Click save. You've successfully created your Lambda function!</p>

	<div class="floating-container">
		<h2>ARN</h2>

		<p>Now remember the reason we came here was because we were looking for an ARN, or Amazon Resource Name. This should be at the top right corner of your page. A couple things to make sure of: your location is in <b>N.Virginia</b>, and your ARN includes <b>us-east-1</b> in it. Remember, this is the only physical location in AWS for Alexa Skills so far. Your skill won't work without this configured properly.</p>

		<p>Navigate back to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/">developer.amazon.com</a>, and in the <b>Configuration</b> tab, paste in the ARN. We don't have to worry about the rest of this page. Click next!</p>
