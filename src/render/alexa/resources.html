		<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html"><h2>AWS Lambda</h2></a>
		<p>In our workshop, we've only barely scratched the surface of what Lambda does. AWS Lambda is an incredible feature that allows you to run code without the overhead of spinning up or managing servers. It's incredibly scalable and very cost effective, as they only charge for what you use. This can be extremely useful for both your Alexa Skill and any other apps that you might build in the future! Here's some more information about AWS Lambda.</p>

		<a href="http://pokeapi.co/docsv2/"><h2>Pokemon API</h2></a>
		<p>Our workshop idea started out as an integration of the Pokemon API. As we worked through the workshop, we realized that using a Web API was more complicated than we'd intended for a simple workshop. If you'd like, to learn how, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-6zbLp/0/1">here's a quick Codecademy tutorial</a> on how to make HTTP requests to APIs on the internet. See if you can integrate the PokeAPI into your skill!</p>
