	<h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>

	<h2>Testing Your Skill</h2>

	<p>At the top of the page, click the <b>Build</b> tab to get back to the Skill dashboard. Ensure that all items under the Skill builder checklist are marked with green checkmarks, otherwise you won't be able to test your skill.</p>

	<p>Back at the top of the page, click the <b>Test</b> tab and enable testing to view the Test Lab.</p>

	<p>On the left, there's an <b>Alexa Simulator</b> where you can interact with Alexa however you want, and on the right, there's a <b>Skill I/O</b> section that isn't enabled yet. Let's activiate it. Type or speak into the Alexa Simulator:</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Open Echomon</p>
	</div>

	<p>This will trigger the Skill I/O section and show a JSON Input and JSON Output. Alexa will speak the welcome response we configured earlier. Now let's try this one out:</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Ask Echomon who is 25?</p>
	</div>

	<p>At this point, your test will fail! Don't panic! This is normal!</p>

	<h2>Debugging</h2>

	<p>Right now, in your JSON Output, you should be seeing</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
		<p class="code">null</p>
	</div>

	<p>Well, that's not very informative. Let's figure out why this is happening.</p>

	<p>Copy the JSON Input and navigate back to the Lambda page in your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS Console</a>.</p>

	<p>At the top, find the dropdown that says <b>Select a test event..</b> and select <b>Configure test event</b>. We'll be creating a new test event with the JSON Input. Name the test whatever you like, paste in the JSON input, and click <b>Create</b>.</p>

	<p>Next to the dropdown menu, click <b>Test</b>. Lambda will run the test with the given input and inform you that the execution has failed. Open up the <b>Details</b> and you'll get an error that looks like the following:</p>

	<pre>
{
  "errorMessage": "name 'should_end_session' is not defined",
  "errorType": "NameError",
  "stackTrace": [...]
}</pre>

	<p>It looks like we're missing a variable called <span class="code">should_end_session</span>. Looking at the stack trace, it'll point you to a line number inside the <span class="code">get_pokemon_name</span> function. Looks like we forgot to include it here!</p>

	<p>The <span class="code">should_end_session</span> variable determines whether we should end the session or not. For example, if there's an error and you want Alexa to prompt the user to try again, you would set <span class="code">should_end_session = False</span>, whereas if Alexa has completed the task, you'll set <span class="code">should_end_session = True</span>. We'll add these accordingly.</p>

	<pre>
if POKEMON_SLOT_NAME in intent['slots']:
    pokemon_number = intent['slots'][POKEMON_SLOT_NAME]['value']
    pokemon_name = get_pokemon(intent['slots'][POKEMON_SLOT_NAME]['value'])
    speech_output = "Pokedex entry " + pokemon_number + " is named " + pokemon_name + "."
    should_end_session = True
else:
    speech_output = "I'm not sure what you mean by that. " \
                    "Please try again."
    should_end_session = False</pre>

    <p>Your if statement should now look like this. Click <b>Save</b> again, then <b>Test</b> again, and the execution result should succeed!</p>

    <p>Let's got back to your <a href="https://developer.amazon.com">developer console</a> and run the same command again. This time, you should get a Lambda response in JSON, and under <span class="code">response.outputSpeech.text</span>, it should print what you've told her to say.</p>

    <h2>Edge Cases</h2>

    <p>Don't forget that it's always good practice to test your edge cases. Remember that the list we've provided consists of first generation Pokemon. This means that only asking for Pokemon #1 through #151 are valid. If you ask Alexa "Who is 200", the Lambda response will be invalid.</p>

	<p>Since this isn't an Alexa specific debugging issue, see if you can debug this yourself! Remember that the <span class="code">value</span> stored inside of our request object is a string, not an integer. To convert from string to integer, you can use <span class="code">int(string)</span>.</p>
