	<div class="floating-container">
		<h2>Setup</h2>
		<p>Make sure you've made all the accounts necessary. If you haven't, <a href="https://wrkshp.github.io/alexa/#setup">go back to the Setup section</a> and follow all of the steps.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Adding a New Skill</h2>

	<p>Navigate to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/">developer.amazon.com</a> and sign in. Now, click the <b>Alexa</b> tab and select the <b>Alexa Skills Kit</b>. Click <b>Add a New Skill</b> in the top right corner.</p>

	<p>Now we need to fill in a few fields to identify our skill.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Skill Type</span> is our custom interaction model, which includes our intents and slots. It's our custom way of talking to Alexa.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Language</span>. Choose English for now, or whatever language you want to interact with Alexa with.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Name</span> is the name shown in the skills store. It can be anything you want.</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Invocation Name</span> is what name we use when we talk to Alexa. For example, if our invocation name is "Echomon", we would say, "Ask Echomon to ____".</li>
		<li><span class="emphasis">Global Fields</span>. We don't need to worry about this for now. This is mostly if you want your skill to play music. For our purposes, we will be saying no.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Hit <b>Save</b> to move onto the Interaction Model.</p>
