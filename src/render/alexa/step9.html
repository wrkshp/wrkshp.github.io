	<div class="floating-container">
		<h2>Publishing</h2>

		<p>The final step of your skill would be to publish your skill into the Alexa Skills Store. In any other skill, you will move onto the <b>Publishing Information</b> and complete the fields as it asks. These are fairly self explanatory, and you should be able to figure them out yourselves. Unfortunately, you will not be able to publish this particular Pokemon skill, as Pokemon is copyrighted by Nintendo.</p>

		<p>If it's any incentive, Amazon offers <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion">a free shirt</a> each month to developers who successfully publish a skill. Make sure to follow all the terms and conditions in order to get the shirt!</p>
